
Mining Tasks
* extracting entities
* extracting relations and atttributes
* axioms and rules (extracting complex axioms and rules that can be used for reasoning purposes)

Difficulties
* complexity of target semantics
  * it's easier to find salient terms in text than identifying their entity types
* specificity of target semantics
  * easier to identify semantically similar entities than identifying ones that are synonyms
* availability of appropriate data
  * easier to look for synonyms in an encyclopedic text vs a news article.

* using Diffbot NL api to get entity and fact extraction
